# Final HTML Test: Ravotter

## Summary and goals
The objective of this project is to, as a group, think of a new company and provide a website for it. Fully functional and designed with all the relevant tests in mind, this website is to be a finished project. Completely applicable.

## Main design
We chose a simple, but effective design of a white page scrolling over parallax headers, with a Nav-bar on top. The red and orange color-scheme is aimed at a fun, cheerful atmosphere. The header images are meant to show a place that is fit for kids, fun and professional. 

## Nav bar
The nav bar is completely opaque when at the top, turning into a sticky navigation bar fitting the theme as soon as the user scrolls down. It does not affect the main landing, but does become a useful, ever-present tool when scrolling down. As such, it is non-disruptive without losing function.

## Parallax
The headers are images fitting the content of the page and highlighting the atmosphere. they are full-width and scroll under the page content, bringing the content into focus. It also makes the content fresh and clean.
